# RTL-Implementation-of-Greatest-Common-Divisor
Verilog HDL is used to implement the GCD System which consist data path and control path.
In a typical processor, data path refers to the part of the processor that performs arithmetic and logical operations, while the control path manages the sequencing and control of these operations. In the context of GCD calculation, the data path would be responsible for performing the actual GCD computation, while the control path would manage the overall process.
